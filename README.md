# liberation-circuit

version: beta

This the beta version of Liberation Circuit, an RTS/programming game.

To play, run LibCirc.exe.

It should compile on any OS supported by Allegro 5 - to build, compile the c files in the source directory and link with Allegro 5.

You will also need the data files from the Windows release, and the game requires write access to its base directory to save mission progress.

Don't try to compile the .c files in the /proc or /story subdirectories! They are code used by the game itself.
